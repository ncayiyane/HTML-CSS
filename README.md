    <p>We've gone from having 21 elements in HTML tags that first documen, to having 100 more elementsnow and yet it's still the same language. I find that amazing. It's still the same language that was created 25 years ago. It's grown an extra 100 elements in there, and yet it's still the same language.</p>
